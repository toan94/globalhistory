Rockefeller&rsquo;s name was synonymous with the &ldquo;Robber Barron&rdquo; predatory business practices associated with his Standard Oil company. His only son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., dedicated his life to recasting the family image. A companion to the PBS American experience video series, this site includes an introduction to the Rockefellers and their eras, a timeline, a teacher&rsquo;s guide, a map of Rockefellers&rsquo; mark on America, and descriptions of notable individuals and events. Also of note is a video interview of Princeton economist Paul Krugman discussing the Rockefellers&rsquo; relevance in today&rsquo;s economy. Special features include an activity where you can attempt to create your own oil monopoly. Primary sources at the site include letters and first-hand accounts from the Rockefellers. You are invited to participate in an online poll and vote whether Rockefeller&rsquo;s methods were legitimate and if the U.S. economy has benefited from the precedent set by the Standard Oil trust.</p>\n\n<p>Illinois During the Gilded Age<br />\nIllinois During the Gilded Age is not only useful to Illinoisans learning about their state&rsquo;s history, as it also illuminates larger themes in the history of the United States during the Gilded Age as well. Illinois In the Gilded Age is a great site for Gilded Age issues, especially labor and politics. Produced by the Northern Illinois University Libraries&rsquo; Digitization Unit, the site offers background articles, analytical essays, lesson plans, and interactive maps. It also features video lectures by experts on Gilded Age topics. A must see!</p>\n\n<p>The Great Chicago Fire and the Web of Memory<br />\nA first-rate exhibition created by the Chicago Historical Society and Northwestern University. There are two major parts: the history of Chicago in the 19th century, and how the Chicago Fire has been remembered over time. Included are essays, galleries, and sources.</p>\n\n<p>Coal Mining in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era<br />\nThis series of articles by the Ohio State University history department explores multiple facets of coal mining. Among the topics are its importance to the American economy, the work of a coal miner in the 1870s, the special hazards of coal mining, how reformers used the coal industry to persuade Americans to support measures to abolish child labor, and various strikes. Images, charts, and link supplement the text articles.</p>\n\n<p>View J.P.

There are sections on Twain&rsquo;s life and career and his major works featuring an array of text and images &mdash; even era advertisements. A quirky feature is an interactive game based on one Mark Twain designed and patented to help remember historical facts. A great site to explore Twain&rsquo;s identity.</p>\n\n<p>Immigration in America&nbsp;<br />\nThe Library of Congress feature provides an introduction to the study of immigration to the United States. There are student activities, educator guides, photos and links to useful resources. The presentation was shaped by the primary sources available in the Library&rsquo;s online collections and probing questions such as &ldquo;Why did each immigrant group come to the United States?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How did United States government policies and programs affect immigration patterns?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Immigration to the United States, 1789-1930<br />\nA Harvard University web-based collection, this site contains a huge collection of primary sources on immigration to the United States, including 1,800 books and pamphlets, 13,000 pages from manuscripts and 9,000 photographs. The collection has very broad coverage and though the amount of information could be overwhelming, the web site is easy to navigate. Included is material from Jacob Riis, who exposed the horrible living conditions New York City slums, and Jane Addams, a social worker and activist who created the Hull House.
