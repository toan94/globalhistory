The central burial had been thoroughly looted in antiquity and archaeologists were only able to recover one arrowhead and some bone fragments.

He was interred with a rare large grey clay amphorae, fittings from a horse&rsquo;s bridle, an iron battle axe, bronze and bone arrows and the star of the funerary show: an akinakes (a Scythian dagger or short sword) with a gold plated scabbard, a grip with a leaf motif and a cross-guard with granulation details.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Not only had the young warrior been buried together with his weapons, but also with some ornaments; the archeological team found beads made of glass paste, a red deer tooth necklace, a gold earring and a gold pendant with chalk inlay.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gold-jewelry.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gold-jewelry-150x100.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px\" /></a>The Mount Mamai burial grounds, the largest barrow cemetery in the region and one of the largest in Europe, has been excavated for 32 years, a long-term salvage operation to recover as much archaeological material as possible before the site is destroyed by erosion from the construction of the Khakhovka Reservoir. Already a quarter mile of the shore has fallen into the lake in just three decades, so archaeologists are fighting a battle against time. Artifacts and remains dating as far back as the Neolithic era through the Middle Ages have been unearthed there. Of the 700 burials thus far excavated, around 400 are Scythian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fittings-from-the-tomb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fittings-from-the-tomb-150x100.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px\" /></a>The discoveries made this season are so exceptional the 32nd dig has been dubbed the most successful yet. The very fine grave goods would be more than significant on their own, but the burial is even more notable because it dates to the 6th century B.C., making it the earliest Scythian burial found at Mount Mamai and extending the window of the cemetery&rsquo;s usage during the Scythian period. The other Scythian tombs that have been excavated there are at least two centuries older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objects have been cleaned and will be conserved at the Museum of Local History in Kamianets-Dniprovsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gilded-scabbard.jpg\"><img alt=\"Gilded scabbard after cleaning.

The also-autonomous government of Catalonia has not been receptive. Ferran Mascarell, Catalan Minister for Culture, said on Thursday that the government will do everything in its power to keep the frescoes where they are on the ground that if Catalans hadn&rsquo;t conserved the frescoes, they would not exist today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a solid legal argument, as the Catalan government has good reason to know since it too has campaigned vigorously for the return of historically significant items from places where they were conserved. Most recently the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/the-first-stolen-spanish-civil-war-documents-are-returned-to-their-legitimate-owners-73-years-later\" target=\"_blank\">Salamanca Papers</a>, a vast number of documents, books, magazines, newspapers and more that Franco pillaged from universities, trade unions, political parties, private homes, publishers etc. in 1939, have begun to be repatriated after a decades-long struggle in the legislature and courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar%C3%ADa-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar%C3%ADa-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-2-150x112.jpg\" style=\"height:112px; width:150px\" /></a>Aragon has wanted the frescoes back for a long time, but the government wasn&rsquo;t the official owner of the monastery and thus had no legal rights to claim the frescoes. The Order of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem has owned the historic building for eight centuries, although their nuns left in 1835 after anti-clerical legislation promulgated by Queen Isabel II&rsquo;s prime minister Juan &Aacute;lvarez Mendiz&aacute;bal privatized monastic properties thus stripping the convent of its revenue. Some nuns filtered back over the years and since 1985, the Order of St. John has allowed the sisters of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://english.bethleem.org/monasteres/sigena.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bethlehem and the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno</a>&nbsp;to carry on the tradition of monastic prayer at Santa Mar&iacute;a de Sigena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar%C3%ADa-la-Real-de-Sijena.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar%C3%ADa-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg\" style=\"height:103px; width:150px\" /></a>The Order of St. John couldn&rsquo;t just hand over the monastery without getting permission from the Vatican. Finally earlier this year the Vatican granted the Order permission to cede the rights to Aragon, so now the Aragonese government is the proud owner of a 13th century monastery in the Spanish Pyrenees. That gives them the right to take Catalonia to court should they refuse to hand over the frescoes. Since Catalonia only possesses the works because they were sent there in 1936 for conservation, not because their ownership was officially transferred, any legal battle is likely to favor the repatriation. The frescoes were removed by order of government during the Civil War, and are therefore spoils of war just like the Salamanca Papers. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1923, which also puts the frescoes&rsquo; removal in contravention of pre-existing Spanish law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg\" style=\"height:91px; width:150px\" /></a>Santa Mar&iacute;a de Sigena was built between 1183 and 1208 by order of Queen Sancha of Castile. Intended to house nuns from the cream of Spanish aristocracy, the monastery was built in rich Romanesque style and was elaborately decorated. No expense was spared. The frescoes on the arches and vaults of the chapter house &mdash; plant and animal motifs accompanying scenes from the Old and New Testament and 70-80 portraits of the ancestors of Jesus starting with Abraham &mdash; were painted by the best English artists using precious materials like gold and lapis lazuli. This approach was employed nowhere else in Spain at this time. Historians believe the frescoes were painted by English artists who also worked on the Guardian Angels Chapel in Winchester Cathedral, the chapel of St. Anselm in Canterbury Cathedral and on mosaics in Norman-ruled Sicily in the mid-12th century. Queen Sancha was buried in the convent church after her death, as were her daughters Dol&ccedil;a and Leonor and her son King Pedro II of Aragon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-150x100.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px\" /></a>Its royal burials and architectural and artistic beauties couldn&rsquo;t save it from a hideous fate during the Civil War. In fact, they probably condemned it. Santa Mar&iacute;a de Sigena was burned in 1936 by Republicans forces who were no fans of the monarchy or the Church. The royal tombs were desecrated Vultures followed to pick at the carcass and looters helped themselves to everything they could take, including the art on the walls, the wooden paneling, the devotional objects, the furniture. The chapter house frescoes were horribly damaged by the fire, some destroyed completely, some missing large pieces, all drained of their once-brilliant color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-150x106.jpg\" style=\"height:106px; width:150px\" /></a>To save what was left, in 1960 the paintings were removed and sent to the National Museum in Barcelona. There they were conserved, ultimately finding permanent placement affixed to arches and vaults designed to replicate the convent chapter house&rsquo;s structure. The museum has an impressive collection of Romanesque frescoes removed from the walls of other churches and monasteries. You can take a tour of the museum&rsquo;s Romanesque rooms&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museu-nacional-dart-de-catalunya?museumview&amp;location=41.368911743164062%2C2.1539034843444824%2C0.949999988079071%2Ct5l-1jZhfAt5BKNKREs87A&amp;hl=en&amp;projectId=art-project\" target=\"_blank\">on Google Art Project</a>.

In 1974 the cloister was rebuilt. Between 1988 and 2009, the government of Aragon undertook an extensive program of restoration costing 3,350,447.71 euros ($4,425,271.34). Now that the structure is stable, Aragon wants to return the frescoes to their original location in the chapter house.</p>\r\n', 'approved', 'Author17'),

It is a vividly colored tableau of the Virgin Mary, Christ Child, senior St. Elizabeth and junior John the Baptist. The marble-smooth, luminous quality of the skin, the glossy surface are characteristic of Bronzino&rsquo;s style. He was influenced by the sculptures of Michelangelo and revival of Classical sculptural styles embraced by artists like Michelangelo and this work is an example of him at the apex of his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>A second version of the present work was bequeathed in 1941 by Sir Lionel Faudel-Phillips to the National Gallery, London. Its provenance cannot be traced before its appearance in 1916.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bronzino is known to have created multiple versions of the same composition on several other occasions. He maintained that changing luminosity to mimic different times of the day allowed the viewer to appreciate different tones and colors, while requiring few changes or adjustments to the composition itself. The painting in London and the work now at the Getty are set at night and at dawn, respectively. The moonlight of the picture in London enhances the concision of the forms, while the diffused light of the dawn intensifies the bright, contrasting colors in the Getty painting.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bronzino_getty_ng.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bronzino_getty_ng-430x266.jpg\" style=\"height:266px; width:430px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This version of the painting first appears on the historical record in 1898 when it was sold in Milan. It was misattributed to Andrea del Sarto. It was sold into private hands and fell off the radar until 1964 when it appeared in a London sale. This time it was correctly attributed to Bronzino, his signature having been found in the lower left of the work. Again it was sold to a private collector and would only be published in 2016. Now it has been bought in yet another a private sale, only this time the buyer is a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bronzino_02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bronzino_02-200x236.jpg\" style=\"height:236px; width:200px\" /></a>Before it was put on display in Gallery N204 in the Getty Center&rsquo;s North Pavilion, the painting and its gilded auricular frame were examined by conservators.

The immediate impetus was the new king&rsquo;s triumphal entry into the city of Lyons, whose emblem is the lion, on July 12th, 1515. The city gave Francis a lion of pure gold, and the pope rolled with the theme. The lion was also a shared motif between the parties as the pope&rsquo;s chosen pontifical name (Leo) and the designer&rsquo;s given name (Leonardo from the Old German &ldquo;strong as a lion&rdquo;). The lilies symbolized a connection between France and Leo X. Leo, born Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, was a native of Florence, and a stylized lily was on the coat of arms of both France (fleur-de-lis) and Florence (giglio Fiorentino).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lyons had a thriving community of Florentine merchants and bankers. Their patron was the pope&rsquo;s nephew, Lorenzo di Piero de&rsquo; Medici, lord of Florence, and soon-to-be father of Catherine, future queen consort of France and mother to three kings of France. It was Lorenzo who brought the lion, manufactured by Leonardo in Florence, with him to the Lyons extravaganza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leo had good reason to curry favor with the new king. By 1515, the Papal States and France were on opposing sides on the War of the League of Cambrai and at the same time Francis was making his processional entry into Lyon, his army was poised to cross the Alps and retake the Duchy of Milan. Leo&rsquo;s attempts at rapprochement began as soon as Francis ascended the throne in January 1515. On February 22nd, the pope officiated at the wedding of his brother Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici to Philiberta of Savoy, Francis&rsquo; maternal aunt. The extravagant lion was the embodiment of the hopefully expanding bonds &mdash; familiar, commercial, political, military &mdash; between the powerful families and states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s da Vinci&rsquo;s walking lion was written about for decades after its smash hit debut by the likes of Vasari and even Michelangelo, but detailed plans for it, if they existed, have not survived even amidst the hundreds of pages of anatomical, architectural and conceptual notes left behind by the Renaissance man. The best account we have comes second-hand from painter Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo who in 1584 wrote that Francesco Melzi, Leonardo&rsquo;s student and favorite who would accompany him to France for the last years of his life, described the mechanical lion thus: &ldquo;once in front of Francis I, King of France, he made walk from his place in a hall, a Lion, made with admirable artifice, and after stopping, opened its chest full of lilies and diverse flowers.&rdquo; Lomazzo later wrote that the lion was made to locomote &ldquo;by power of wheels,&rdquo; likely a reference to the internal gear system rather than the wheels near its feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recreation now on display in Paris is based on a few sketchy notes and designs in the Codex Madrid I. Researchers from the Leonardo 3 Museum used partial diagrams, including one of a pulley and wheel connected to legs, as a foundation, but many additional extrapolations were necessary to fill in what is basically a giant blank. One important assumption was that the lion walked by means of a system of springs and gears Leonardo would have known from Italian watchmakers and from Arabic automata that were then popular in Venice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mechanical-lion-exploded.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mechanical-lion-exploded-430x430.jpg\" style=\"height:430px; width:430px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lion will be exhibited until October 9th.</p>\r\n', 'approved', 'hacker'),

The most complete recipe is for a frozen chocolate product &mdash; a 17th century frapp&eacute;, if you will &mdash; and in an age when freezing was still a subject of extensive scientific study rather than the subject of cookbooks, Sandwich&rsquo;s frapp&eacute; may be the earliest English recipe on record for an iced chocolate treat.</p>\n\n<p>Loveman specializes in 17th century English literature, especially the diarists. She was reading the papers of Samuel Pepys who repeatedly mentions drinking chocolate at London coffee houses which served coffee, chocolate and tea, all recent introductions courtesy of the Age of Exploration that were viewed with suspicion for their dubious medical properties/dangers and enthusiasm for their dubious medical properties/tastiness. On April 24th, 1661, the day after the coronation of King Charles II,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4131/4131-h/4131-h.htm#2H_4_0018\" target=\"_blank\">Pepys writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Waked in the morning with my head in a sad taking through the last night&rsquo;s drink, which I am very sorry for; so rose and went out with Mr. Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate to settle my stomach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chocolate as a hangover cure, sure, why not? This was less than 10 years after chocolate was first brought to England in 1652 and it was already being presented as an aphrodisiac and fertility aid, a link to sensuality that still dominates chocolate advertising to this day. It was also supposed to aid in digestion and to provide healthy nutrients to make &ldquo;such as drink it often, Fat, and Corpulent, faire and Amiable.&rdquo; (The fat and corpulent bit was seen as a feature not a bug.)</p>\n\n<p>The Earl of Sandwich was one of Pepys&rsquo; patrons. He is often mentioned in the journal, so Loveman decided to follow up by reading the unpublished manuscript of Montagu&rsquo;s journal. She found a 30-page section dedicated to chocolate written in 1668 after the Earl returned from serving as England&rsquo;s ambassador to Spain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics-150x100.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px\" /></a>Chocolate had been introduced to Europe through Spain when Spanish ships began to transport cacao from Central and South America in the first half of the 16th century. Initially it did not make a great impression. Cocoa is very bitter indeed without sugar, but the addition of spices like cinnamon and later with cane sugar made it palatable enough for the habit to be acquired. By the early 17th century, chocolate was a popular elite beverage in Spain, served at Court along with sweets, pastries and snow. They also drank it in public, a social custom known as a Xocolatada or Chocolatada. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.museuceramica.bcn.es/english/colecc/frmcolecc02.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>La Xocolatada</em></a>, a Catalan ceramic tile piece from 1710 illustrating the Spanish custom of chocolate made and consumed as a communal, but still elite, tradition.)</p>\n\n<p>From Spain, chocolate spread to France where its trade became a state monopoly and only the aristocracy were allowed to indulge. Louis XIII&rsquo;s wife Queen Anne of Austria, daughter of King Philip III of Spain, was an avowed chocolate lover. When she married Louis in 1615, she ensconced the fashion for chocolate in the highest echelons of French society.</p>\n\n<p>England came to the chocolate game a few decades later, first through translations of a 1631 book about chocolate written by Spanish doctor Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma which were published in the 1640s and in 1652. The title page of the 1652 translation notes that the chocolate described in the volume could be purchased &ldquo;at reasonable rates&rdquo; from bookseller John Dakins in Holborn. Booksellers often sold medicines and nostrums at this time, which is how chocolate got on the menu.</p>\n\n<p>The first free-standing advertisement for chocolate published in&nbsp;<em>The Publick Adviser</em>&nbsp;in June 1657:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Bishopsgate Street in Queen&rsquo;s Head Alley, at a Frenchman&rsquo;s house, is an excellent West Indian drink called chocolate, to be sold, where you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade, at reasonable rates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich-150x122.jpg\" style=\"height:122px; width:150px\" /></a>The Earl of Sandwich&rsquo;s 30 pages leans heavily on Spanish expertise. He includes Colmenero de Ledesma&rsquo;s instructions on how to prepare chocolate, plus 10 pages from a spy in Madrid who reported on the Spanish manufacturing process. First the nuts were dried and ground, then sugar and spices (chile peppers, cinnamon and aniseed were the favorites) were ground separately and then cooked together. This produced a thick paste that would keep for a long time once hardened. The Spanish would add hot water to the paste and whip it, adding more water and sugar to taste. The result was a thick, sludgy beverage that even with the sugar was still bitter (it takes an enormous amount of sugar to de-bitterize chocolate, as anyone who has tried to make hot chocolate straight from cocoa powder has learned the hard way).</p>\n\n<p>Montagu collected all this information with a political aim, not just out of personal interest. Cromwell&rsquo;s Navy had taken Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655, and there were lots of cacao plantations in Jamaica. As ambassador to Spain, Sandwich had signed a new commercial treaty with Spain cementing the status of Britain&rsquo;s new West Indian territories. Now England had reliable access to the raw materials of chocolate-making, a rich potential market for the restored Crown. Upon his return to England, Montagu was appointed to the Privy Council&rsquo;s committee for trade and foreign plantations, so his research was relevant to his job as well.</p>\n\n<p>King Charles II was very much interested personally. He and Sandwich discussed chocolate together and one of the recipes in Montagu&rsquo;s journal he got directly from the King. From Loveman&rsquo;s paper,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/08/18/jsh.sht050.short\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Introduction of Chocolate into England: Retailers, Researchers, and Consumers, 1640&ndash;1730</em></a>, published in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Social History</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sandwich soon obtained a recipe for a chocolate &ldquo;leaven cake&rdquo; described as &ldquo;the Kings receipt for which he gave 200 libre&rdquo; &mdash; that is apparently, if barely credibly, &pound;200. The recipe involved mixing three pounds of cacao nuts with oil of Jamaican pepper, oil of aniseed, oil of cinnamon, cardamom, and Guinea pepper to create tablets that could be stored. &ldquo;To make the Chacolatte it selfe&rdquo; then required adding cacao nuts, sugar, and a vanilla pod to &ldquo;the Leaven.&rdquo; Perfumed sugar, using musk, ambergris, and civet, could be added to taste</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mmm&hellip; Civet musk&hellip; That sounds like something out of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/292\" target=\"_blank\">the Futurist Cookbook</a>. I dearly hope the King didn&rsquo;t actually pay &pound;200 for that.</p>\n\n<p>The recipe for the frozen chocolate is considerably more appetizing, and it utilizes what was then the cutting edge research of Robert Boyle who had experimented with freezing and published&nbsp;<em>New Experiments and Observations Touching Cold</em>&nbsp;in 1665. It was Boyle who found that adding salt to snow was necessary in order to freeze liquids placed inside a vessel which would be in turn placed inside a container of salted snow.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the Earl of Sandwich&rsquo;s recipe for Curdled Chocolate Ice:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prepare the chocolatti [to make a drink] &hellip; and Then Putt the vessell that hath the Chocolatti in it, into a Jaraffa [i.e. a carafe] of snow stirred together with some salt, &amp; shaike the snow together sometyme &amp; it will putt the Chocolatti into tender Curdled Ice &amp; soe eate ^it with spoons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll take that over the musk chocolate any day. The concept of frozen beverages didn&rsquo;t catch on in England right away. Ices were popular already in Italy, but in England they were considered dangerous to the health. Sandwich made a point of noting of how to counteract this chilling effect: &ldquo;one is oblidged for better security to Drinke Hott chocolatti in 1/4 of an houre after.&rdquo; Then wait another hour before going in the water.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Loveman made the Curdled Ice herself and she said it was like a very thick frappucino minus the dairy.</p>\n', 'approved', 'Dr Doctor');

The unmailed letter was found with the blouse, Mr. Mangum said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remnants of officers&#39; wardrobes are common, he said, but enlisted men&#39;s uniforms are extremely rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Mangum said the helmet was one of three from that period known to have survived.

But are they real?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is no &mdash; and yes. The widespread medieval use of iron maidens is an 18th-century myth, bolstered by perceptions of the Middle Ages as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/45297-barbarians.html\">an uncivilized era</a>. But the idea of iron-maiden-like devices has been around for thousands of years, even if evidence for their actual use is shaky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iron maiden has been described as a human-sized box festooned with interior spikes. The hapless torture victim would be forced inside and the door would shut, driving the spikes into the body. The spikes were supposedly short and positioned so that the victim wouldn&#39;t die quickly, but would bleed out over time. Creepy, right? [<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/11338-medieval-torture-10-biggest-myths.html\">Medieval Torture&#39;s 10 Biggest Myths</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And basically fictional. The first historical reference to the iron maiden came long after the Middle Ages, in the late 1700s. German philosopher Johann Philipp Siebenkees wrote about the alleged execution of a coin-forger in 1515 by an iron maiden in the city of Nuremberg. Around that time, iron maidens started popping up in museums around Europe and the United States. These included the Iron Maiden of Nuremberg, probably the most famous, which was built in the early 1800s and destroyed in an Allied bombing in 1944. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Siebenkees wasn&#39;t the first to dream up a terrible box full of nails as a torture device, though. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120101.htm\">The City of God</a>,&quot; a Latin book of Christian philosophy written in the fifth century A.D., tells a tale of torture of the Roman general Marcus Atilius Regulus, who was locked in a nail-studded box. Marcus didn&#39;t die of being impaled, though; he was forced to stay awake lest the nails pierce his skin, and eventually died of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/52592-spooky-effects-sleep-deprivation.html\">sleep deprivation</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greek historian Polybius, who lived around 100 B.C., spread a related story. Polybius claimed that the Spartan tyrant Nabis constructed a mechanical likeness of his wife Apega. When a citizen refused to pay his taxes, Nabis would have the faux wife wheeled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When the man offered her his hand, he made the woman rise from her chair and taking her in his arms drew her gradually to his bosom,&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/13*.html\">Polybius wrote</a>. &quot;Both her arms and hands as well as her breasts were covered with iron nails &hellip; so that when Nabis rested his hands on her back and then by means of certain springs drew his victim towards her &hellip; he made the man thus embraced say anything and everything. Indeed by this means he killed a considerable number of those who denied him money.&quot;</p>\r\n'),

The Roman scourge, also called the &quot;flagrum&quot; or &quot;flagellum&quot; was a short whip made of two or three leather (ox-hide) thongs or ropes connected to a handle as in the sketch above. The leather&nbsp;thongs were knotted with a number of small pieces of metal, usually zinc and iron, attached at various intervals. Scourging would quickly remove the skin. According to history the punishment of a slave was particularly dreadful. The leather was knotted with bones, or heavy indented pieces of bronze.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes the Roman scourge contained a hook at the end and was given the terrifying name &quot;scorpion.&quot; The criminal was made to stoop which would make deeper lashes from the shoulders to the waist. According to Jewish law (discipline of the synagogue) the number of stripes was forty less one (Deut. 25:3) and the rabbis reckoned 168 actions to be punished by scourging before the judges. Nevertheless, scourging among the Romans was a more severe form of punishment and there was no legal limit to the number of blows, as with the Jews. Deep lacerations, torn flesh, exposed muscles and excessive bleeding would leave the criminal &quot;half-dead.&quot; Death was often the result of this cruel form of punishment though it was necessary to keep the criminal alive to be brought to public subjugation on the cross. The Centurion in charge would order the &quot;lictors&quot; to halt the flogging when the criminal was near death.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

A metal forceps or pliers, often heated red-hot, individually grasps each nail in turn and slowly pries it from the nail bed before tearing it free from the digit. A more painful variant used in medieval Spain was performed by introducing a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail and slowly hammering the wedge under the nail until it was torn free.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denailing#cite_note-2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;Along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_roasting\">foot roasting</a>, this savage procedure was used to break the Knights Templar, the remarkably bitter cruelty sometimes literally shattering knights&#39; sanity. Another cruel variant of the denailing torture involved using rough skewers of wood or bone dipped in boiling sulfur. A number of such skewers were slowly driven into the flesh under the prisoner&#39;s toenails. Alternately, the skewer was dipped in boiling oil, which served a dual purpose of both burning the incredibly sensitive flesh and lubricating the needle so that the torturer could freely explore a wide surface area beneath the toenail. When enough skewers had been driven home to pry each nail loose from its bed, the nail was torn out at the root with a pair of pliers. This was a favorite technique of torture in the German witch-hunter&#39;s arsenal, being extremely inexpensive, portable, and easy to inflict. More recently, the denailing torture found favorite application during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide\">Armenian genocide</a>&nbsp;of the 1910s.

His grandfather began the family&rsquo;s long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted 382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience. and inspiring his &ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham Jail&rdquo;, a manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his address, &ldquo;l Have a Dream&rdquo;, he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named Man of the Year by&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.</p>\r\n'),

After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to stay for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family, and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress\">Indian National Congress</a>&nbsp;in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women&#39;s rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchability\">untouchability</a>, and above all for achieving&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaraj\">Swaraj</a></em>&nbsp;or self-rule.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth, or short&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoti\">dhoti</a></em>&nbsp;and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel, or&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_wheel#Charkha\">charkha</a></em>, as a mark of identification with India&#39;s rural poor. Thereafter, he lived modestly in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarmati_Ashram\">self-sufficient residential community</a>, ate simple vegetarian food, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fasts_undertaken_by_Mahatma_Gandhi\">undertook long fasts</a>&nbsp;as a means of self-purification and political protest.

There is a long-held belief that the construction authorities forced the pharaohs&rsquo; servants to build the pyramids but this is not true. Workers willingly volunteered to build the pyramids and were paid on a daily basis. They were also given complimentary food to keep them healthy and strong in order to keep building the pyramids as the stones were heavy and they had little technology to help them. It is almost impossible to believe that humans did all the work manually, and research is still being carried out into what tools the Egyptians of that era used to attain such precision in measurement and alignment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The pyramids faced exactly due north</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the pyramids that were made were built on the west bank of the river Nile, the only river that flowed through Egypt. It was also considered the national highway at that time as people felt that waterways were the best way to transport goods. They also used to believe that their sun god would travel with them on the water in his own solar boat. The buildings were made of limestone, and the outer layer was polished to a high sheen. The reflective nature of this surface helped to deflect the sunlight and keep the mummies preserved. The position of the setting sun was thought to be where the kingdom of the dead was and so the pyramids were located where the sun set and not where it rose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another observation that was made about the pyramids was that they all pointed to the north, and the pole star was precisely above the pyramid. Another fascinating fact is that the positioning of the pyramids resembled constellations, and it remains a mystery how the Egyptians were able to be so precise without any advanced knowledge in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt\" src=\"https://www.ancienthistorylists.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/giza-pyramid.jpg\" style=\"height:371px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we now call the Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and the greatest pyramid of the three pyramids found there. This pyramid is one of the seven wonders of the world. It was built for Pharaoh Khufu of the eighth dynasty and constructed between 2580 and 2560 BC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It contains chambers specially made for the king and queen, the Robbers&rsquo; Tunnel, a modern opening gate, the Grand Gallery, and a huge void deep inside the pyramid. Approximately 2.3 billion rocks were used to make this pyramid, but its precise dimensions are difficult to work out as they are in Egyptian units. There are not many other pyramids that are as intriguing as the Giza pyramid making it a favorite tourist destination. Most of the government&rsquo;s revenue from tourism is due to the popularity of this pyramid.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),

Coins with her portrait show her with manly features and a large, hooked nose, though some historians contend that she intentionally portrayed herself as masculine as a display of strength.

In 1672 the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/admiral-michiel-de-ruyter-2361146\">Third Anglo-Dutch War</a>&nbsp;disrupted trade with Europe and in the 1680s, other European trading companies began to grow and increase the pressure on the Dutch East India Company. Furthermore, European demand for Asian spices and other goods began to change around the middle of the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the turn of the 18th century the Dutch East India Company had a short resurgence in power but in 1780 another war broke out with England and the company began to have serious financial troubles. During this time the company survived because of support from the Dutch government (Towards a New Age of Partnership).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its problems, the charter of the Dutch East India Company was renewed by the Dutch government until the end of 1798. Later it was again renewed until December 31, 1800. At this time though the powers of the company were greatly reduced and the company began to let go of employees and dismantle headquarters. Gradually it also lost its colonies and eventually, the Dutch East India Company disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Organization of the Dutch East India Company</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In its heyday, the Dutch East India Company had a complex organizational structure. It consisted of two types of shareholders. The two were known as the&nbsp;<em>participanten</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>bewindhebbers</em>. The&nbsp;<em>participanten&nbsp;</em>were non-managing partners, while the&nbsp;<em>bewindhebbers&nbsp;</em>were managing partners. These shareholders were important to the success of the Dutch East India Company because their liability in the company consisted only of what was paid into it. In addition to its shareholders, the Dutch East India Company&#39;s organization also consisted of six chambers in the cities of Amsterdam, Delft, Rotterdam, Enkhuizen, Middleburg, and Hoorn. Each of the chambers had delegates that were chosen from the&nbsp;<em>bewindhebbers&nbsp;</em>and the chambers raised the beginning funds for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Importance of the Dutch East India Company Today</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization of the Dutch East India Company is important because it had a complex business model that has extended into businesses today. For example, its shareholders and their liability made the Dutch East India Company an early form of a limited-liability company. In addition, the company was also highly organized for the time and it was one of the first companies to establish a monopoly over the spice trade and it was the world&#39;s first multinational corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dutch East India Company was also important in that it was active in bringing European ideas and technology to Asia.

He was to spend his youth in the nightmare politics of the Wars of the Roses but he was a survivor. So was his mother, the thirteen-year-old Lady Margaret Beaufort, great-granddaughter on the wrong side of the blanket of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, by Katherine Swynford. That the Beauforts were subsequently legitimized still left a question mark over their political position, but Lady Margaret was a rich enough heiress to make possession of her a profitable investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small, slight, shrewd and determined, Margaret was twelve when she was married to Edmund Tudor, son (ostensibly at least) of Owen Tudor, which brought a link with the French royal house into the equation. The Tudors were Anglesey landowners and Owen Tudor became a courtier of Henry V and met Henry Vs young wife, Catherine of Valois, the daughter of Charles VI of France. There were stories that he caught the Queen&#39;s eye when she saw him swimming, or that he tripped and fell into her lap when dancing. When Henry V died in 1422, Queen Catherine was left a widow at twenty and, according to one chronicler, &#39;was unable fully to curb her carnal passions&#39;. She apparently had a love affair with Edmund Beaufort, future duke of Somerset, but it was Owen Tudor she married, on the quiet, the first widowed queen of England to remarry for 300 years. Her sons Edmund and Jasper Tudor stood high in the favour of their half-brother Henry VI, who created them earls of Richmond and Pembroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gossip made Edmund Tudor the son of Queen Catherine&#39;s affair with Edmund Beaufort, who was Lady Margaret&#39;s uncle. If so, Henry VII was not Welsh, and a Beaufort on both sides, but the gossip did not prevent Margaret Beaufort being married off to Edmund Tudor in 1455. Getting her with child despite her youth secured him a life interest in her substantial inherited estates, but he died the following year, when she was six months pregnant. Perhaps damaged by giving birth so young, she would have no more children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile she went for protection to Jasper Tudor and it was in his stronghold of Pembroke Castle that she gave birth to the baby Henry. The following year she married Henry Stafford, a son of the Duke of Buckingham, to gain his protection and avoid having another husband forced on her. In 1462, when the young Henry Tudor was five years old, he was taken away from her and his wardship was given to William, Lord Herbert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young Henry had never known a father and had now been parted from his mother as well. The Herberts seem to have treated him kindly and he was given a gentleman&#39;s education, but Lord Herbert was executed in 1469. Henry stayed on with Lady Herbert and in 1470, when he was thirteen, he had an audience with Henry VI. Later Tudor propaganda had it that the pious, half-mad king prophesied that the boy would one day rule England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Henry returned to his Uncle Jasper and they were soon standing siege by a Yorkist army in Pembroke Castle. They managed to get away by ship to Brittany in 1471 and Duke Fran&ccedil;ois gave them shelter and protected Henry from England&#39;s Yorkist king, Edward IV, who wanted him in his own hands. Louis XI of France also tried to get Henry into his clutches. It was a desperately insecure situation and it is little wonder that the young Tudor came to manhood cautious, prudent and deeply reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the death of Edward IV in 1483, the succession of Richard III, the disappearance of the princes in the Tower and the deaths of other Lancastrian claimants left Henry Tudor, however improbably, as a credible claimant to England&#39;s throne. He was encouraged by his mother, who was plotting against Richard III. Henry led an invasion from Brittany in 1485, defeated Richard III at Bosworth and became king of England at the age of twenty-eight. His mother, who burst into floods of tears at his coronation, died a few weeks after him, in 1509.</p>\r\n\r\n');

Emperors were usually present, even when they had no particular taste for the events such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Marcus_Aurelius/\">Marcus Aurelius</a>. Titus and Claudius were noted for shouting at the gladiators and other members of the crowd and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/commodus/\">Commodus</a>&nbsp;himself performed in the arena hundreds of times. One vestige of the earlier Etruscan tradition continued, however, with the presence of the attendant whose job was to finish off any fallen gladiator by a blow to the forehead. This attendant wore the mythical costume of either Charon (the Etruscan minister of Fate) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Hermes/\">Hermes</a>, the messenger god who accompanied the dead down to the underworld.

Spectacles often lasted from dawn till nightfall and the gladiators usually kicked-off the show with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/chariot/\">chariot</a>&nbsp;procession accompanied by trumpets and even a hydraulic organ and then dismounted and circled the arena, each saluting the emperor with the famous line:&nbsp;<em>Ave, imperator, morituri te salutant!</em>&nbsp;(Hail, Emperor, those who are about to die salute you!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comic or fantasy duels often began the day&rsquo;s combat events, these were usually fought between women, dwarfs or the disabled using wooden weapons. The following blood sports between various classes of gladiators included weapons such as swords, lances, tridents, and nets and could also involve female combatants. Next came the animal hunts with the bestiarii -- the professional beast killers. The animals had no chance in these contests and were most often killed at a distance using spears or arrows. There were dangerous animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants, leopards, hippopotamuses and bulls but there were also events with defenceless animals such as deer, ostriches, giraffes and even whales. Hundreds, sometimes even thousands of animals, were butchered in a single day&rsquo;s event and often brutality was deliberate in order to achieve&nbsp;<em>crudeliter</em>&nbsp;-- the correct amount of cruelty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Domitian, dramas were also held in the Colosseum but with a bloodthirsty realism such as using real condemned prisoners for executions, a real&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/hercules/\">Hercules</a>&nbsp;was burned on a funeral pyre and in the role of Laureolus&nbsp; a prisoner was actually crucified. The Colosseum was also the scene of many executions during the lunch-time lull (when the majority of spectators went for lunch), particularly the killing of Christian martyrs. Seen as an unacceptable challenge to the authority of Pagan Rome and the divinity of the Emperor, Christians were thrown to lions, shot down with arrows, roasted alive and killed in a myriad of cruelly inventive ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/image/952/bronze-sestertius-with-colosseum/\"><img alt=\"Bronze Sestertius with Colosseum\" src=\"https://www.ancient.eu/img/r/p/500x600/952.jpg?v=1569519763\" style=\"height:500px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Later History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 404 CE, with the changing times and tastes, the games of the Colosseum were finally abolished by Emperor Honorius, although condemned criminals were still made to fight wild animals for a further century. The building itself would face a chequered future, although it fared better than many other imperial buildings during the decline of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/empire/\">Empire</a>. Damaged by earthquake in 422 CE it was repaired by the emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian III. Repairs were also made in 467, 472 and 508 CE.&nbsp; The venue continued to be used for wrestling matches and animal hunts up to the 6th century CE but the building began to show signs of neglect and grass was left to grow in the arena. In the 12th century CE it became a fortress of the Frangipani and Annibaldi families. The great earthquake of 1231 CE caused the collapse of the southwest facade and the Colosseum became a vast source of building material - stones and columns were removed, iron clamps holding blocks together were stolen and statues were melted for lime. Indeed, Pope&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Alexander/\">Alexander</a>&nbsp;VI actually leased the Colosseum as a quarry. Despite this crumbling away though, the venue was still used for the occasional religious procession and play during the 15th century CE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Renaissance period both artists and architects like Michelangelo and later tourists on their Grand Tour took a renewed interest in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Roman_Architecture/\">Roman architecture</a>&nbsp;and ruins. As a consequence, in 1744 CE Pope Benedict XIV prohibited any further removal of masonry from the Colosseum and consecrated it in memory of the Christian martyrs who had lost their lives there. This, however, did not stop locals using it as an animal stables and its neglect is reflected in the curious work of Richard Deakin who in 1844 CE catalogued over 420 plant varieties thriving in the ruin, some rare and even locally unique -- perhaps originating from the food given to the exotic animals all those centuries before. The 19th century CE did, though, begin to see the fortunes of the once great amphitheatre improve. The Papal authorities sought to restore parts of the building, notably the east and western ends, with the latter being supported by a massive buttress. Finally, in 1871 CE the Italian archaeologist Pietro Rosa removed all of the post-Roman additions to reveal, despite its degradation, a still magnificent monument, a poignant and enduring testimony to both the skills and the vices of the Roman world.</p>\r\n'),

Newton also made seminal contributions to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics\">optics</a>, and shares credit with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz\">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>&nbsp;for developing the infinitesimal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus\">calculus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>Principia</em>, Newton formulated the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion\">laws of motion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation\">universal gravitation</a>&nbsp;that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity\">theory of relativity</a>. Newton used his mathematical description of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity\">gravity</a>&nbsp;to prove&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\">Kepler&#39;s laws of planetary motion</a>, account for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide\">tides</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory\">trajectories</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet\">comets</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession\">precession of the equinoxes</a>&nbsp;and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\">Solar System</a>&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism\">heliocentricity</a>. He demonstrated that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)\">motion of objects</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth\">Earth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object\">celestial bodies</a>&nbsp;could be accounted for by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics\">same principles</a>. Newton&#39;s inference that the Earth is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids\">oblate spheroid</a>&nbsp;was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis\">Maupertuis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marie_de_La_Condamine\">La Condamine</a>, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton built the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope\">first practical reflecting telescope</a>&nbsp;and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_prism\">prism</a>&nbsp;separates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#Visible_radiation_(light)\">white light</a>&nbsp;into the colours of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum\">visible spectrum</a>. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks\">Opticks</a></em>, published in 1704. He also formulated an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling\">empirical law of cooling</a>, made the first theoretical calculation of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound\">speed of sound</a>, and introduced the notion of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid\">Newtonian fluid</a>. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem\">binomial theorem</a>&nbsp;to non-integer exponents, developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method\">a method</a>&nbsp;for approximating the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function\">roots of a function</a>, and classified most of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_plane_curve\">cubic plane curves</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton was a fellow of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge\">Trinity College</a>&nbsp;and the second&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics\">Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge\">University of Cambridge</a>. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\">Trinity</a>. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders\">holy orders</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England\">Church of England</a>. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy\">alchemy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_Bible\">biblical chronology</a>, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whigs_(British_political_party)\">Whig party</a>, Newton served two brief terms as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\">Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge</a>, in 1689&ndash;90 and 1701&ndash;02.

Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.

They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early church writings and show that in the conflict between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius\">Athanasius</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius\">Arius</a>&nbsp;which defined the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed\">Creed</a>, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\">Trinity</a>. Newton &quot;recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980315-117\">[115]</a>&nbsp;He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, &quot;the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Apostasy\">great apostasy</a>&nbsp;was trinitarianism.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980321-118\">[116]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980331%E2%80%93334-119\">[117]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Newton&#39;s eyes, worshipping Christ as God was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry\">idolatry</a>, to him the fundamental sin.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1994124-120\">[118]</a>&nbsp;Historian&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Snobelen\">Stephen D. Snobelen</a>&nbsp;says, &quot;Isaac Newton was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy\">heretic</a>. But&nbsp;... he never made a public declaration of his private faith&mdash;which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-heretic-116\">[114]</a>&nbsp;Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socinian\">Socinian</a>&nbsp;sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism\">Arian</a>&nbsp;and almost certainly an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-trinitarian\">anti-trinitarian</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-heretic-116\">[114]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a minority position, T.C. Pfizenmaier offers a more nuanced view, arguing that Newton held closer to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Arian\">Semi-Arian</a>&nbsp;view of the Trinity that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ\">Jesus Christ</a>&nbsp;was of a &quot;similar substance&quot; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiousios\">homoiousios</a>) from the Father rather than the orthodox view that Jesus Christ is of the &quot;same substance&quot; of the Father (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoousios\">homoousios</a>) as endorsed by modern Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Protestants.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Was_Isaac_Newton_an_Arian?-121\">[119]</a>&nbsp;However, this type of view &#39;has lost support of late with the availability of Newton&#39;s theological papers&#39;,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-122\">[120]</a>&nbsp;and now most scholars identify Newton as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism\">Antitrinitarian</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheist\">monotheist</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-heretic-116\">[114]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-dulles-123\">[121]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton&#39;s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-tiner-124\">[122]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with his scientific fame, Newton&#39;s studies of the Bible and of the early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers\">Church Fathers</a>&nbsp;were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism\">textual criticism</a>, most notably&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Historical_Account_of_Two_Notable_Corruptions_of_Scripture\">An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John</em>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-125\">[123]</a>&nbsp;He placed the crucifixion of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ\">Jesus Christ</a>&nbsp;at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-126\">[124]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believed in a rationally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanent\">immanent</a>&nbsp;world, but he rejected the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylozoism\">hylozoism</a>&nbsp;implicit in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz\">Leibniz</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza\">Baruch Spinoza</a>. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the&nbsp;<em>Principia</em>&nbsp;&quot;I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity&quot;.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-127\">[125]</a>&nbsp;He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: &quot;Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice&quot;. But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-128\">[126]</a>&nbsp;For this, Leibniz lampooned him: &quot;God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-129\">[127]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton&#39;s position was vigorously defended by his follower&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Clarke\">Samuel Clarke</a>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz-Clarke_correspondence\">famous correspondence</a>. A century later,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace\">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>&#39;s work &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9_de_m%C3%A9canique_c%C3%A9leste\">Celestial Mechanics</a>&quot; had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-130\">[128]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\">Trinity</a>. His first biographer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Brewster\">Sir David Brewster</a>, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-131\">[129]</a>&nbsp;In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes\">John Maynard Keynes</a>&nbsp;(among others) were deciphered<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-The_Collected_Writings_of_John_Maynard_Keynes_Volume_X-55\">[54]</a>&nbsp;and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-heretic-116\">[114]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effect on religious thought</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg/220px-Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg\" style=\"height:169px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(Blake)\">Newton</a></em>, by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake\">William Blake</a>; here, Newton is depicted critically as a &quot;divine geometer&quot;.

Newton gave Boyle&#39;s ideas their completion through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof\">mathematical proofs</a>&nbsp;and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Enlightenment_and_Religion:_Rational_Dissent_in_eighteenth-century_Britain-135\">[133]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Occult</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies\">Isaac Newton&#39;s occult studies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology\">eschatology</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 (never intended to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, but it is not given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Snobelan-136\">[134]</a>&nbsp;The passage is clear, when the date is read in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So then the time times &amp; half a time [<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic\">sic</a></em>] are 42 months or 1260 days or three years &amp; an half, recconing twelve months to a year &amp; 30 days to a month as was done in the Calender [<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic\">sic</a></em>] of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of [long-]lived kingdoms the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-137\">[135]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, and it is not for us to know the times and seasons which God hath put into his own breast.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton\'s_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse-138\">[136]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Snobelan-136\">[134]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Alchemy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the character of Morton Opperly in &quot;Poor Superman&quot; (1951), speculative fiction author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Leiber\">Fritz Leiber</a>&nbsp;says of Newton, &quot;Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone\">philosopher&#39;s stone</a>. That was the pebble by the seashore he really wanted to find.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Heinlein-139\">[137]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton&#39;s papers, about one million deal with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy\">alchemy</a>. Many of Newton&#39;s writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Mann-92\">[91]</a>&nbsp;Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Meyer-140\">[138]</a>&nbsp;Some of the content contained in Newton&#39;s papers could have been considered heretical by the church.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Mann-92\">[91]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloging Newton&#39;s papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby&#39;s.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Kean-141\">[139]</a>&nbsp;The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about &pound;9,000.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Greshko-142\">[140]</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes\">John Maynard Keynes</a>&nbsp;was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton&#39;s collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Mann-92\">[91]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Kean-141\">[139]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Dry-143\">[141]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of Newton&#39;s known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University\">Indiana University</a>: &quot;The Chymistry of Isaac Newton&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Indiana-144\">[142]</a>&nbsp;and summarised in a book.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-145\">[143]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-146\">[144]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Newton&#39;s fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton&#39;s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, &quot;chymistry.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-Indiana-144\">[142]</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coulston_Gillispie\">Charles Coulston Gillispie</a>&nbsp;disputes that Newton ever practiced alchemy, saying that &quot;his chemistry was in the spirit of Boyle&#39;s corpuscular philosphy.&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-147\">[145]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enlightenment philosophers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment\">Enlightenment</a>&nbsp;philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&mdash;Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&mdash;as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\">nature</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law\">natural law</a>&nbsp;to every physical and social field of the day.
